This folder contains the project code that I did in Carmel for enrichment.

What I was able to do was control the mini-robot from a Tkinter interface,
but the objective was to be able to control it via PS3 controller or a 
web interface.

I was able to find a module called webiopi that would have allowed me to 
control it via web interface, but without having the mini-robot at hand
to test, it was a major hastle trying to figure out what was going wrong 
since we only had one session a week the the robot.

I also did some research on controlling it with a PS3 controller which I
have, but it was the same case that it would have been a hastle testing.

If I was to re-do this project, I'd love to have more time spent with 
the robot so I'd be able to test all of my code as soon as I've wrote it.

I guess this shows that I'd rather have whatever I'm working on right
there so I can play with it, but if that's not always possible, I'll 
have to work on my code debugging skills to think of any possible 
mistakes that I could have made. Or, I could simply write a few variations
of my code and try each one in turn, hoping that one works and if it does
then excellent, otherwise, I better get working on my debugging skills!
